# Build a Movie Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering 

### Abstract
I am going to build a recommendation engine to recommend movies based on a movie that we have watched.
This project is an interactive movie recommendation system that allows you to type in a movie name and immediately get ten recommendations for other movies you might want to watch.   

### Walkthroughs
* Reading data in Pandas
* Cleaning up the data using Regex
* Building an interactive search box
* Creating an recommendation widget

### Tools
* Jupyter Notebook 
* Python
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * Regex
  * Sciki-learn
  * Ipython
  * Ipywidgets

### Discussion & Next Steps
Here are some ideas that can help to improve and to extend the recommendation system: 
* Using the genres to add a second input box to filter the recommendation by a specific genre
* Using the genres to improve the actual recommendation engine
* Finding a dataset with metadata like tags for these movies, use it to improve the recommendation

### Here are some thoughts that I would like to share....
After understanding the different algorithms of how to design recommendation systems, I began to pay attention to the things recommended to me on social medias and shopping websites, including the titles recommended to me and the methods recommended to me. I was able to find that the difference in algorithms affects the recommended content.  
For example, if you think you may like this product, it may be based on your past buying habits to make recommendations. 
Or,  people who have watched this video have also watched other videos. This may be based on the recommendation of people who like the same content, just like our project.  
It is not difficult to design a recommendation system, but it is not easy to design a suitable recommendation system in the right place. In other words, it is necessary to choose the right algorithm. Of course, past experience and the size of the database are also important things.
