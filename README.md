# Build a Movie Recommendation System Using Collaborative Filtering 

### Abstract
I am going to build a recommendation engine to recommend movies based on a movie that we have watched.
This project is an interactive movie recommendation system that allows you to type in a movie name and immediately get ten recommendations for other movies you might want to watch.   

### Walkthroughs
* Reading data in Pandas
* Cleaning up the data using Regex
* Building an interactive search box
* Creating an recommendation widget

### Tools
* Jupyter Notebook 
* Python
  * Numpy
  * Pandas
  * Regex
  * Sciki-learn
  * Ipython
  * Ipywidgets

### Discussion & Next Steps
Here are some ideas that can help to improve and to extend the recommendation system: 
* Using the genres to add a second input box to filter the recommendation by a specific genre
* Using the genres to improve the actual recommendation engine
* Finding a dataset with metadata like tags for these movies, use it to improve the recommendation
